### Quick Note

In generation 6, along with the seed of a given frame, a secondary seed called TinyMT is used to determine some parts of a Pokemon when encountering a Pokemon, including the species, level, and held item. This guide are for those who have an understanding of how to RNG in Pokemon XY and ORAS, and have a basic understanding of TinyMT and how to advanced TinyMT frames. For more in depth explanation of what TinyMT is, I would recommend reading Bambo-Rambo's RNG guide that goes more into depth or TinyMT [here](https://github.com/Bambo-Rambo/RNG-Guides/blob/main/NormalWild-FS-RNG.md).  For a quick runthrough, the following is a reminder of the different ways of advancing TinyMT frames.

Within the bag...
* Turning on/off the EXP Share = 3 * [Number of Pokemon in Party] (E.g. 6 Pokemon = 18 TinyMT index advancements, 5 Pokemon = 15 TinyMT index advancments).
* Teaching a TM to a Pokemon and reject it on the move selection screen = 1 TinyMT index advancement.
* Exiting the bag to the X menu and entering the bag again immediately = 16 TinyMT index advancement (Outside of Caves) **OR** 4 TinyMT index advancement (Caves)


### Introduction

In generation 6, when using honey or sweet scent in most areas, hordes are generated instead of single wild Pokemon.
